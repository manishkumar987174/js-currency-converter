# js-currency-converter
This is a simple and interactive currency converter built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to select currencies, enter an amount, and view real-time converted values using live exchange rates.

The app uses JavaScript's DOM API to dynamically update elements based on user interactionâ€”such as changing currency selections, input amounts, and displaying results. Events like click, change, and submit are handled using Event Listeners, making the interface interactive and responsive. DOM manipulation ensures that all changes reflect immediately without reloading the page.

The UI is clean, responsive, and provides real-time feedback to users for an enhanced experience.
